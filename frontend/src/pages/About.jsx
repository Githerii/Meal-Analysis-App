      <p>
        Githeriâ€™s Meal Analysis App helps users search for meals, view
        ingredients, and get calorie estimates. Data is fetched from the
        MealDB API, and users can mark favorite meals for easy access later.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I plan to add a login feature and a section where users
        can track or suggest their own meals.
